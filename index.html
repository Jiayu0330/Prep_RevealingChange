      Techniques to Highlight the Meaningful Changes in Data Visualizations

    <ul>
        <li>Time Series Line Chart</li>
          <p>In Cairo's words, "The X-axis (horizontal) in this kind of chart
             represents equally spaced time intervals, and the Y-axis (vertical)
             corresponds to the magnitude of the variables we wish to explore or
             present" (P???). This kind of chart helps us find the changes of data
             by paying attention to the trend and seasonality.
          </p>

              This is an example of time series line charts. It shows the
              California's health insurance coverage from 1995 to 2010. By
              plotting the health insurance coverage in each year, we can see
              the change of health insurance coverage, which goes up after 2000
              and stay constant. Annotations in specific years help us better
              understand the change.<br>

        <li>Seasonal Subseries Chart</li>
          <p>It is a powerful tool for detecting seasonality in a time series.
             However, we need to know the period of the seasonality to plot the
             chart. Monthly data is good because it has a period of 12. We can
             see the change of data clearly by looking at the difference between
             group and within group.

              This is an example of seasonal subseries charts. It is about the
              sales trends by year within each month. In this chart, we can
              easily compare the sales of each month. The black lines show the
              trend in performance for each moth, while the gray horizontal lines
              show the average sales for each month.<br>

        <li>Zero-based Indexed Chart</li>
          <p>Using zero-based indexed chart can tell us the difference between
             data and the index origin.<br>
             Percentage change = ((Each score – Index origin) / Indexorigin) × 100
          </p>
        <li>Horizon Chart</li>
          <p>It is useful when you need to "display dozens of line charts
             simultaneously" (P???).<br>
             Three steps to make a horizon chart:<br>
             (1) subdivide its vertical scale evenly, and color code positive
             and negative values,<br>
             (2) mirror the color bands corresponding to
             negative values, and then<br>
             (3) collapse the color bands. Following
             these steps results in a much shorter chart.
